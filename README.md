🧠 Project Overview
Pearlswap is a modern decentralized exchange (DEX) inspired by Uniswap, built to help developers master Web3 development, smart contracts, and dApp architecture. Created by CodeSpark Engineering, this project is ideal for launching your blockchain development career through hands-on experience.
🚀 Features

🏦 Token swapping interface with liquidity pool mechanics
🔐 Smart contracts written in Solidity
🌐 Web3 integration using Ethers.js
🧪 Local blockchain testing with Hardhat
💬 MetaMask wallet connectivity
📊 Real-time pool and token data display

🛠️ Tech Stack

Solidity – Smart contract language
Hardhat – Ethereum development environment
Ethers.js – Web3 library
React.js – Front-end framework
MetaMask – Wallet integration

📲 How It Works

Deploy ERC-20 tokens and Pearlswap smart contracts.
Connect the dApp to MetaMask for wallet interaction.
Users can swap tokens, add/remove liquidity, and view pool stats.
All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
